# SecTester SDK Demo

## About this project

This is a demo project for the Sec Tester JS SDK framework, with some installation and usage examples. We recommend forking it and playing around, that’s what it’s for!

## About SecTester

Bright is a developer-first Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scanner.

SecTester is a new tool that integrates our enterprise-grade scan engine directly into your unit tests.

With SecTester you can:

- Test every function and component directly
- Run security scans at the speed of unit tests
- Find vulnerabilities with no false positives, before you finalize your Pull Request

Trying out Bright’s SecTester is free 💸, so let’s get started!

> ⚠️ The SecTester project is currently in beta as an early-access tool. We are looking for your feedback to make it the best possible solution for developers, aimed to be used as part of your team’s SDLC. We apologize if not everything will work smoothly from the start, and hope a few bugs or missing features will be no match for you!
>
> Thank you! We appreciate your help and feedback!

## About the SDK

The SDK is designed to provide all the basic tools and functions that will allow you to create the interactions between the Bright scanning engine, run scans on any target and get the results, all in your own console or CI environment.

You can use the SDK command directly, or create a convenient wrapper for your project to integrate security testing directly into your web or testing framework of choice (you can see some examples in the Documentation section)

## Usage

### Getting a Bright API key

1.  Register for a free account at Bright [**signup**](https://app.neuralegion.com/signup)
2.  Create a Bright API key (personal key from your [**UI**](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/manage-your-personal-account#manage-your-personal-api-keys-authentication-tokens)
3.  Save the Bright API key in your project
    1.  We recommend using your Github repository secrets feature to store the key, accessible via the `Settings > Security > Secrets > Actions` configuration. We use the ENV variable called `BRIGHT_TOKEN` in our examples
    2.  More info on [how to use ENV vars in Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables)

### A full configuration example

First install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm ci
```

Then you can start tests with SecTester as follows:

```bash
$ npm run test:sec
```

This can take a few minutes.

### Example of a CI configuration

You can integrate this library into any CI you use, for that you will need to add the `BRIGHT_TOKEN` ENV vars to your CI. Then add the following to your `github actions` configuration:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run sec tests
    run: npm run test:sec -- --testTimeout 300000
    env:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_PASSWORD }}
      POSTGRES_USER: ${{ secrets.POSTGRES_USER }}
      BRIGHT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BRIGHT_TOKEN }}
```

For a full list of CI configuration examples, check out the docs below
